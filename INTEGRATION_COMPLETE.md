## 🔧 **RESOLVED ISSUES**

### ✅ Issue #1: Firebase Environment Variables
**Problem**: Frontend was reporting missing Firebase environment variables (Array(4))
**Solution**: 
- Fixed environment variable naming from `FIREBASE_*` to `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*`
- Restarted frontend development server to pick up new environment variables

**Problem**: Registration endpoint returning 400/500 errors
**Solution**:
- Fixed Firebase Admin SDK configuration in backend with proper private key formatting
- Updated User model data structure to match expected schema
- Fixed address object handling in registration route
- Cleared database of conflicting test data

### ✅ Issue #3: Metadata Viewport Warning
**Problem**: Next.js viewport metadata deprecation warning
**Solution**:
- Moved viewport configuration from metadata export to separate viewport export
- Updated layout.tsx to use proper Next.js 15.2.4 viewport pattern
